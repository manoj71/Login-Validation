Form validation using javascript at front-end and at backend using php and database records. </br>
username should be in the form="user@gmail.com" 
  you can create a database with two field username and password and check if the user is valid,
  I have created database "userdb" and table="user" and used it in my code.
  You can create the database with same name or can do changes in code and test it.
